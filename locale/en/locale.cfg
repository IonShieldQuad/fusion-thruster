thruster-fusion-reactor=Thruster Fusion Plasma Reactor

[technology-name]
fusion-thruster=Fusion Thruster 

[technology-description]
fusion-thruster=Unlocks the ability to mix water and high energy fusion plasma to generate immense thrust. 

[entity-description]
fusion-thruster=Uses the innate power of superheated plasma and the rapid phase change of water to generate immense thrust with absurd efficiency. 
thruster-fusion-reactor=Although similar to [entity=fusion-reactor] this reactor uses water instead of fluoroketone resulting in the high energy plasma lacking the electrodynamic properties necessary to generate electrical power.
